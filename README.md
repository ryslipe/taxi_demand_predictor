# Taxi Demand Predictor Service

This repository is the implementation and completion of the "Real-World ML Tutorial" course by Pau Labarta Bajo. The link to the course can be found here: https://www.realworldml.net/.

In this course we walked through a taxi demand predictor where we fetched live data from the web, cleaned and engineered it, and created a StreamLit app with an interactive NY City map with our taxi demand predictions using a Light GBM model. Frameworks included pandas, numpy, poetry, optuna.
